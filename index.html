    <p>Accenture plc is a global multinational professional services company originating in the United States and headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, that specializes in information technology (IT) services and management consulting. It was founded in 1989. A Fortune Global 500 company, it reported revenues of $64.9 billion in 2024.[3]

        History
        Formation and early years
        Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen in the early 1950s.[4] The division conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky, which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer, believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the United States.[5][6]
        
        Split from Arthur Andersen
        In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC). Throughout the 1990s, tensions grew between the two units. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC, pay the other the 15 percent), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting. This dispute came to a head in 1998, when Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. In 2000, as a result of arbitration, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid $1.2 billion to Arthur Andersen.[7]
        
        On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted the name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" was derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office. Petersen hoped that the name would not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates, because the word itself was meaningless.[8]
        
        Incorporation and public listing
        Accenture was incorporated in Bermuda in 2001. On 19 July 2001, Accenture's initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[9] Because of the split from Andersen, Accenture avoided prosecution on June 16, 2002, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prosecuted Arthur Andersen for obstructing justice and accounting fraud.[10]
        
        Reincorporation in Ireland
        On 26 May 2009, Accenture announced that its board of directors unanimously approved changing the company's place of incorporation from Bermuda to Ireland.[11]
        
        Services and operations
        Accenture's business is organized into five segments:[12]
        <ol>
        <li>Strategy and Consulting</li>
        <li>Technology</li>
        <li>Operations</li>
        <li>Accenture Song (formerly Interactive)</li>
        <li>Industry X</li>
        </ol>
        The company provides services to clients in various industries, including communications, media and technology, financial services, health and public service, consumer products, and resources.[14]</p>
